Open Source Chemical Vapour Deposition Reactor Shematics &amp; Control Software

The aim of this project is to grow diamonds using CVD method.
The CVD Process in general is quite well documented in many papers, however cauculating the dimensions of the chamber (dimensions are apparently critical) and tuning the chamber (vaccum pressure, amount of gas, plasma temperature etc) is where most of the difficulty lies.

## Overview
#### Reactor Construction
We will need a to construct a working reactor
* Vacuume chamber / Pump
* Quarts Viewports
* Gas inlets / Valves
* Magnetron & Waveguides
* More stuff

#### Management Software
We will need software to control all aspects of the reactor
* gas injection inlet timing & pressures (methane/hydrogen) 
* vacuume pressue (control of the vacuume pump)
* power supply to the magnetron (controlling the plasma temperature)

Seed diamond slices are normally used, and the new diamond will be grown (deposited) on top of this starting slice.

I would like to explore alterate methods & substrates, for example to see if it is possible to grow the diamond starting on a thin firm of carbon (graphene).
