Open Source Chemical Vapour Deposition Reactor Shematics &amp; Control Software

The aim of this project is to grow diamonds using CVD method.
We will need a to construct a reactor and also management software to control the (methane/hydrogen) gas injection inlet timing & pressures, the vacuume pressue (control of the vacuume pump), and power supply to the magnetron for controlling the plasma temperature.
Seed diamond slices are normally used, and the new giamond will be grown (deposited) on top of this starting slice. I would like to explore alterate methods & substrates, for example to see if it is possible to grow the diamond starting on a thin firm of carbon (graphene).
